# About
Born in Catania (Italy) in 1969, got a master degree in Computer Science in 1999. Since the degree he worked as researcher in the field of computer vision and augmented reality for the University of Catania. Then he started to work in the Telecommunication industry from 2000 till 2005 for the billing sector. Since 2006 has been employed with a contract based relationship, at the [Institute of Nuclear Physics][INFN] [Dept. of Catania][INFNCT] as Technologist, participating to several European projects starting from the 6th Framework Programe till the latest [H2020][H2020] of the European Commission. From 2018 he got a permanent position at [INFN][INFN] providing support to the scientific calculation and their related distributed computing infrastructures (DCIs).

Below the list of the european projects:

* [EUMEDGrid][EUMED]
* [Egee II][EGEEII]/[Egee III][EGEEIII]
* [EELA-2][EELA2]
* [EUMEDGRID-Support][EUMEDSUP]
* [agInfra][AGINFRA]
* [EarthServer][EARTHSRV]
* [INDIGO-datacloud][INDIGODC]
* [EOSC-hub][EOSCHUB]

# Experiences
Operating systems, software development especially C/C++ and Assembler applied in the context of the computer graphics, have been since ever the core of his interests. His thesis work: "Augmented Reality: An implementation without calibration on low cost machines" has been continued for almost one year while working as researcher for the [University of Catania][UNICT]. In that period he learned methods and algorithms for fast computing calculation, real-time image acquisition, 2D/3D computer graphics, computer vision and augmented reality.

When joined the mobile telecommunication indistry for the billing sector, he learned the [BSCS][BSCS] system, knew the fundamentals of the mobile networks, improved his knowledge with commercial Unix environments Compaq/HP and IBM, shell programming (ksh), Oracle databases, SQL, C/C++, Software maintenance tools (CMVC), Centura for BSCS' GUIs on MS Windows.

Coming back to the research environment, he joined the world of distributed computing infrastructures in the form of [Grid Computing][WLCGGRID] in particular in the context of the Europan Grid Infrastructure ([EGI][EGI]). The Grid infrastructure was using the [EMI][EMI]/[gLite][GLITE32] middleware principally made of open source products operating under Enterprise Linux OSes (Scientific Linux). During the participation of the european projects, almost all of them foreseen a training activity in using and instaling the Grid Middleware and providing user support for running scientific applications on the Grid. This kind of activity involved a wide knowledge of different software environments, interpreters, database engines etc. Key environments for those European projects were the [EGEE][EGEE] and later the [EGI][EGI] intitiatives, both requesting specific knowledge of their internal services and procedures to maintain their own operations. When the Cloud became most popular, European projects like [INDIGO-datacloud][INDIGODC] and [EOSC-hub][EOSCHUB] moved their focus from the Grid to other forms of distributed infrastructures based on it. These platforms are mainly managed by OpenStack plus a set of other specific services to maintain operations. From this period he also focused in the area of the [Science Gateways][SGWS], in particular, designing and implementing the [FutureGateway Framework][FGF] a software initiative aiming to fastly and securely develop community oriented Science Gateways. By this experience he moved professionally more close to the software architecture/development, open software repositories (GitHub), learned modern software development strategies like Agile development and CI/CD. He also integrated the world of Science Gateways with the [Open Access Repositories][OARS] as key tool for the reproducibility in [Open Science][OPENSCI], one of the aspects of the [FAIR][FAIR] data.
